# Sky-Detection-in-Images---A-Computer-Vision-Approach
In this project, I embarked on a journey to understand and implement traditional computer vision techniques, specifically for the task of sky detection in images. My primary goal was to reliably identify the sky region and color it yellow, which involved a series of methodical experimentation with color spaces and thresholding techniques.
